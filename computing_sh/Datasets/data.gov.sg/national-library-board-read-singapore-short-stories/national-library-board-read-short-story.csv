Ideally to be chopped off and discarded, the old tree symbolizes the strength of the main character, Haji Bakri, who shares strong sentiments with the nostalgic events associated with the growth of this tree. Planted when Haji Bakri was eight years old, he and the old tree had seen many changes associated with the development of his neighbourhood.","National Library Board","National Library Board","application/epub+zip :. 16 KB.","eng","All Rights Reserved.
